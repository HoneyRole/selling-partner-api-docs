## Selling Partner API Documentation
Effective January 19, 2022, English Selling Partner API documentation is available on our **new SP-API documentation site** at [https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api)! Check out the new site for all of your SP-API documentation needs and bookmark your most referenced articles. 

The new documentation site offers all English-language developer guides, API references, Use Case Guides, API swagger models, and other technical guides. Additionally, the site includes robust search functionality, the ability to submit feedback on each article, and a whole new look that improves readability. 

We are also launching [Release Notes](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/page/release-notes) for Selling Partner API on the new site!

English-language documentation currently available on GitHub will be replaced with links to the documentation on the new site over the next two weeks. All other language documentation available on GitHub will be maintained until we support additional languages on the new site. We'll let you know when other languages go live. 

GitHub Issues will also remain active for you to ask questions to other developers. We will be adding Community features to the new site over time and will let you know when that functionality is available.
